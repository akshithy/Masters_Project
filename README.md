# Masters_Project
This repository contains all the codes I wrote for my Masters project. These were written at the time when I just started to code, so these are not optimised for efficiency and speed.

All the mathematical expressions and the numerical techniques used are given in the file "Critical_Analysis_Of_Sharp_Phase_Field_Method_Masters_Thesis_Akshith.pdf".
